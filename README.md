# Happle - Word Mixing Game

A fun React TypeScript application that creates new words by mixing halves of different words from your sentences!

## How It Works

1. **Enter a sentence** - Type any sentence in the input field
2. **Generate Happle Words** - Click the button to split each word in half and randomly recombine them
3. **Interactive Results** - Click on the generated "happle" words to interact with them

## Algorithm

The Happle word generation works by:
1. Splitting the input sentence into individual words
2. Dividing each word in half at the midpoint
3. Randomly shuffling the second halves of all words
4. Combining each first half with a randomly selected second half
